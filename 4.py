print "Searching for largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers..."

# initialize two 3-digit number variables
# make them both equal to 999
# store the product of the two numbers in another variable
# check if that number is a palindrome
# if a palindrome, check to see if it is larger than the previous max palindrome
# if not a palindrome, increment down one of the three digit numbers
